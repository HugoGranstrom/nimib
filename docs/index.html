## Secret talk with a computer
Let me show you how to talk with the computer like a [real hacker](https://mango.pdf.zone/)
and incidentally you might learn the basics of [nimib](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib).
### A secret message
Inside this document is hidden a secret message. I will ask the computer to spit it out:
&quot;&quot;&quot;

let secret = [104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100]

nbCode:
  echo secret

nbText: fmt&quot;&quot;&quot;
what does this integer sequence mean?
Am I supposed to [recognize it](https://oeis.org/search?q={secret.join(&quot;%2C+&quot;)}&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search)?

### A cryptoanalytic weapon
Luckily I happen to have a [nim](https://nim-lang.org/) implementation of
a recently declassified top-secret cryptoanalytic weapon:&quot;&quot;&quot;

nbCode:
  func decode(secret: openArray[int]): string =
    ## classified by NSA as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-histories/EC-121.pdf&quot;&gt;TOP SECRET&lt;/a&gt;
    # so secret that they do not want me to tell you and they will remove this message!
    for c in secret:
      result.add char(c)

nbText: &quot;&quot;&quot;
  ### The great revelation
  Now I can just apply it to my secret message and
  finally decrypt what the computer wants to tell me:&quot;&quot;&quot;

nbCode:
  let msg = decode secret
  echo msg

nbText:
  fmt&quot;_Hey_, there must be a bug somewhere, the message (`{msg}`) is not even addressed to me!&quot;

<h2>‚ùì Q &amp; A</h2>
<h3>why the name?</h3>
<p>corruption of <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/Ninib">ninib</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a solar deity; firstborn of Bel and consort was Gula;
god of war and the <em>chase</em> and agriculture; sometimes identified with biblical <em>Nimrod</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He explains that the seven directions were interpreted by the Babylonian theologians
as a reference to the seven great celestial bodies, the sun and moon, Ishtar, Marduk, Ninib, Nergal and Nabu.</p>
<p>This process, which reached its culmination in the post-Khammurabic period, led to identifying
the planet Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Mars with Nergal, Mercury with Nebo, and Saturn with Ninib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I should not need to tell you what <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Marduk</a> is
and why <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/a-major-correction/422514/">Saturn is the best planet</a>.</p>
<h3>why the whale üê≥?</h3>
<p>why do you need a logo when you have emojis?</p>
<p>no particular meaning about the whale apart the fact that I like the emoji and this project is something I have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Ahab">chasing</a> for a while
and I expect to be chasing it indefinitely.</p>
<p>also googling <code>nimib whale</code> you might learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_Coast">Skeleton Coast</a> which is definitely a plus.</p>
<h3>why the emojis?</h3>
<p>because I made a <a href="https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimoji">package</a> for that and someone has to use it</p>
<h3>why the Q &amp; A?</h3>
<p>because <a href="https://github.com/oakes/vim_cubed#q--a">someone made it an art</a>
and they tell me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/558084-imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery-that-mediocrity-can">imitation is the sincerest form of flattery</a></p>
