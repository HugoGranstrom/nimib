<h2>üëã üåç Example Usage</h2>
<p>First have a look at the following html document: <a href="https://pietroppeter.github.io/nimib/hello.html">hello</a></p>
<p>This was produced with <code>nim r docs/hello</code>, where <a href="https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib/blob/main/docs/hello.nim">docs/hello.nim</a> is:</p>
<pre><code class="nim hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> strformat, strutils
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> nimib

nbInit

nbText: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;&quot;
## Secret talk with a computer
Let me show you how to talk with the computer like a [real hacker](https://mango.pdf.zone/)
and incidentally you might learn the basics of [nimib](https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimib).
### A secret message
Inside this document is hidden a secret message. I will ask the computer to spit it out:
&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> secret = [<span class="hljs-number">104</span>, <span class="hljs-number">101</span>, <span class="hljs-number">108</span>, <span class="hljs-number">108</span>, <span class="hljs-number">111</span>, <span class="hljs-number">44</span>, <span class="hljs-number">32</span>, <span class="hljs-number">119</span>, <span class="hljs-number">111</span>, <span class="hljs-number">114</span>, <span class="hljs-number">108</span>, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>]

nbCode:
  <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> secret

nbText: <span class="hljs-string">fmt&quot;&quot;&quot;
what does this integer sequence mean?
Am I supposed to [recognize it](https://oeis.org/search?q={secret.join(&quot;%2C+&quot;)}&amp;language=english&amp;go=Search)?

### A cryptoanalytic weapon
Luckily I happen to have a [nim](https://nim-lang.org/) implementation of
a recently declassified top-secret cryptoanalytic weapon:&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

nbCode:
  <span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> decode(secret: openArray[<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>]): <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> =
    <span class="hljs-comment">## classified by NSA as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/70/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-histories/EC-121.pdf&quot;&gt;TOP SECRET&lt;/a&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># so secret that they do not want me to tell you and they will remove this message!</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> c <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> secret:
      <span class="hljs-literal">result</span>.add <span class="hljs-built_in">char</span>(c)

nbText: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;&quot;&quot;
  ### The great revelation
  Now I can just apply it to my secret message and
  finally decrypt what the computer wants to tell me:&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

nbCode:
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> msg = decode secret
  <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> msg

nbText:
  <span class="hljs-string">fmt&quot;_Hey_, there must be a bug somewhere, the message (`{msg}`) is not even addressed to me!&quot;</span>

nbSave <span class="hljs-comment"># use nbShow to automatically open a browser tab with html output</span></code></pre>

<h2>API</h2>
<h3>external API</h3>
<p>By external API we mean the following templates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nbInit</code> (<em>always required</em>): it initializes the notebook,
the other templates are not accessible if nbInit is not called.</li>
<li><code>nbText</code>: it is followed by any expression that evaluates to a string.
this text is by default assumed to be markdown and it will be rendered as html
thanks to <a href="https://github.com/soasme/nim-markdown">nim-markdown</a>.</li>
<li><code>nbCode</code>: followed by a block of code, it will execute the code,
and capture the output. It will be rendered in the final html document
as a block of nim code followed by preformatted text.</li>
<li><code>nbSave</code>: it is required to save the document to a file.
Rendering takes place at this moment.
By default the document will be save as an html (templated with <a href="https://github.com/soasme/nim-mustache">nim-mustache</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>other templates on top of the four basic ones will likely be added.</p>
<h3>internal api</h3>
<p><code>nbInit</code> creates two variables <code>nbDoc</code> and <code>nbBlock</code>, which are injected in the scope.
At every block of code or text (or else) <code>nbBlock</code> is updated and added to <code>nbDoc</code>.
<code>nbBlock</code> is a ref object, so changes done to it after a block will be reflected in
the content of <code>nbDoc</code>.</p>
<p>The specific types <code>NbDoc</code> and <code>NbBlock</code> are unstable and they will likely change,
but it is likely that access the following elements will be guaranteed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nbDoc.blocks</code>: container of all the blocks</li>
<li><code>nbDoc.render</code>: a closure from NbDoc to string that produces the rendered document</li>
<li><code>nbBlock.output</code>: string with the output of a nbCode/nbText block (not yet rendered)</li>
<li><code>nbBlock.code</code>: stringification of the code block through AST.
if it appears different than what you typed it is because nim likes it better that way.
In particular only documentation comments survive this process and normal comments will
not appear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are two examples that show how to abuse the internal api:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="%7Bdocs%7D/nolan.html">nolan</a>: how to mess up the timeline of blocks ‚è≥</li>
<li><a href="%7Bdocs%7D/pythno.html">pythno</a>: a reminder that nim is not python üòú</li>
</ul>

<h2>Rendering</h2>
<h3>html rendering</h3>
<p>There are two levels of html rendering.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>render-in-the-small</strong>: rendering html fragments. This is mostly taken care by nim-markdown
and by appropriate semantic tagging in render functions (this can be overriden).</li>
<li><strong>render-in-the-large</strong>*: putting together html fragments and other elements to publish one or more documents.
this is delegated to nim-mustache and to manual creation and update of json and context fields in doc and block objects.</li>
</ol>
<h3>markdown rendering</h3>
<p>For an example on how to output Markdown see <a href="%7Brepo%7D/blob/main/docs/index.nim">docs/index.nim</a>,
which automatically renders the <code>README.md</code> in the repo.</p>
<h2>Other features</h2>
<h3>styling</h3>
<p>Default style is provided by <a href="https://watercss.kognise.dev/">water.css</a>.
Style can be customized.</p>
<h3>code highlighting</h3>
<p>Code highlighting is provided by <a href="https://highlightjs.org/">highlight.js</a>.
The script <code>{assets}/{highlight}</code> contains highlighting assets only for nim language.
The default css style for highlighting is <code>{assets}/{defaultHighlightCss}</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to change the style pick one using <a href="https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/">highlight demo page</a>
(select all languages to find Nim) and make the appropriate change in <code>templates/head.mustache</code>.</p>
<h3>latex</h3>
<p>Rendering latex expressions is an opt-in feature provided by <a href="https://katex.org/">katex</a>.
The delimiter supported are <code>$</code> for inline-math and <code>$$</code> for display math.
Latex is rendered through an autodetection during document loading.</p>

## static assets

*TODO*

## filesystem

*TODO*

default situation for single article that does not access filesystem:

* you do not have to worry about nothing.
  the new html will appear next to your nim file with same name and html extension

if you need to change name or location of html output, or if you need to access
filesystem (in particular if you need it for your web assets), this is what you need to know:

* with nbInit a number of paths are initialized
* we follow compiler/pathutils which is available (exported) from nim paths.
  (along with os stuff also exported)
* nbThisFilename (string): name of this file (with nim extension).
* nbThisDir (RelativeDir): directory where this nim file resides
* nbThisFile (RelativeFile): this should be a template that gives nbThisDir + nbThisFilename
* npProjectDir (AbsoluteDir): the reference directory for the project.
  looks for a nimble file starting from nbThisDir in parent dirs.
  This should be the only Absolute path,
  all other paths should be relative to this path.
* nbProjectFile (RelativeFile): path (and also name since it is
  relative to the nbProjectDir) of the nimble file found as reference for the project.
  (what happens if multiple nimble files are found?)
* nbCurDir (RelativeDir): template that returns current directory.
  it should be set at the beginning as equal to nbProjectDir (with change of directory).
* nbDoc.dir (RelativeDir): this is directory where the specific nbDoc
  (there can be more than on) will be written to. Defaults to nbThisDir.
* nbDoc.filename (string): name of the output document *without extension*
  (default: nbThisFilename removing nim extension). or maybe with extension??
  should I add some magic in order to have a change of filename to check
  if it has extension and add it automatically?
* nbDoc.ext (string): extension (default: html)
* nbDoc.file (RelativeFile): nbDoc.dir + nbDoc.filename + nbDoc.ext
* the above fields of nbDoc become then an API that should be guaranteed for NbDoc object.

other thoughts

- should I add a Filename and Ext distinct string to pathutils?
- since I never remember which slash should I use maybe I could introduce
  a +/- operator that work on this distinct strings
- also I should introduce readfile, writefile for this type of objects.

## Roadmap

remember to open issue for 1.x detailing clean ups and fixing expected before adding new features.

Examples:
  - escapeTag should be default or not (currently it is not, I think it should)
  - improve nbImage/nbFigure
  - possiblity to show full source (button in footer? show directly for pythno and nolan)
  - nbHtml? integrate an html DSL?
  - doubleDoc and better handling of Md vs Html
  - highlight done in nim
  - add timing data in blocks
  - add logging block by block
  - add error management (at least runtime, possibly also compiletime)
  - add plots for numerical?

focus for 0.2:

- use it and fix stuff around
- expand features for blogging use case
  + frontmatter for md documents
  + easy publication to dev.to
  + publish date, update, categories, author
  + a basic blogging theme
  + investigate how established software does it (jekyll, hugo, ...)
- clean up API and improve implementation (especially for NbBlock and rendering)

later on:

- more features to build static sites (other than blogging, for example library documentation or mdbook)
- client-side dynamic site: interactivity of documents, e.g. a dahsboard (possibly taking advantage of nim js backend)
- nimib executable for scaffolding and to support different publishing workflows
- possibility of editing document in the browser (similar to jupyter UI, not necessarily taking advantage of hot code reloading)
- server-side dynamic sites (streamlit style? take advantage of caching instead of hot code reloading)


## Thanks

to:

* soasme for the excellent libraries nim-markdown and nim-mustache, which provide the backbone of nimib rendering and customization
* clonk for help in a critical piece of code early on (see SO question)
* baf03 for tempfile, which elegantly fills a stdlib gap

<h2>‚ùì ‚ùó Q &amp; A</h2>
<h3>why the name?</h3>
<p>corruption of <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/Ninib">ninib</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a solar deity; firstborn of Bel and consort was Gula;
god of war and the <em>chase</em> and agriculture; sometimes identified with biblical <em>Nimrod</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He explains that the seven directions were interpreted by the Babylonian theologians
as a reference to the seven great celestial bodies, the sun and moon, Ishtar, Marduk, Ninib, Nergal and Nabu.</p>
<p>This process, which reached its culmination in the post-Khammurabic period, led to identifying
the planet Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Mars with Nergal, Mercury with Nebo, and Saturn with Ninib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I should not need to tell you what <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Marduk</a> is
and why <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/a-major-correction/422514/">Saturn is the best planet</a>.</p>
<h3>why the whale üê≥?</h3>
<p>why do you need a logo when you have emojis?</p>
<p>no particular meaning about the whale apart the fact that I like the emoji and this project is something I have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Ahab">chasing</a> for a while
(and I expect to be chasing it indefinitely).</p>
<p>also googling <code>nimib whale</code> you might discover the existence of a cool place: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_Coast">Skeleton Coast</a>.</p>
<h3>why the emojis?</h3>
<p>because I made a <a href="https://github.com/pietroppeter/nimoji">package</a> for that and someone has to use it</p>
<h3>why the Q &amp; A?</h3>
<p>because <a href="https://github.com/oakes/vim_cubed#q--a">someone made it into an art form</a>
and they tell me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/558084-imitation-is-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery-that-mediocrity-can">imitation is the sincerest form of flattery</a></p>
